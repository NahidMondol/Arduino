  A bread board contains a red led, a green led and a potentiometer. The input value of the potentiometer determines the 
  brightness of the green led on the board. When the potentiometer reaches its max value (furthest it can turn), then the
  red led light turns on. If the potentiometer is turned back down, the red light will turn off.
