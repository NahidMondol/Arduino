/*
  A breadboard which contains an arduino uno, a joystick, 2 green leds and 2 red leds. The 2 green leds indicate the x and y value of the joystick
  if it surpasses a certain direction and the 2 red leds indicate if they surpass in the other direction. The four different lights indicate what
  direction the user is moving the joystick. If the joystick is left untouched, the lights will be off. If the user clicks the joystick, all 4
  lights will turn on.
