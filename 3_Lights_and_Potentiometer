/*
  A breadboard that contains a red led, a green led, a blue led, and a potentiometer. When the potentiometer is turned to
  its lowest value, the blue light will turn on, and the two other lights will be off. When the value of the potentiometer is
  increased, the blue light will turn off, while the green light adjusts brightness based off of the value of the potentiometer.
  When the potentiometer reaches its max value, the red light will turn on.
