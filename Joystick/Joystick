/*
  A breadboard that contains an arduino nano and a joystick. The joystick contains 5 GPIO slots which contain
  (GRND, +5V, VRX, VRY, and SW)
  GRND should be connected to the ground of the arduino.
  +5V should be connected to the 5V pin of the arduino to give the joystick power.
  VRX is the x-axis of the joystick and should be connected to an analog pin because the value is adjustable.
  VRY is the y-axis of the joystick and should be connected to an analog pin because the value is adjustable.
  SW represents when the joystick is pressed down/clicked and should be connected to a digital pin
  This program allows the user see the x, y and click values represented by a number when the user 
  interacts with the joystick.
